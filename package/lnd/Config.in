	  The Lightning Network Daemon (lnd) - is a complete
	  implementation of a Lightning Network node and currently
	  deployed on testnet3 - the Bitcoin Test Network. lnd has
	  several pluggable back-end chain services including btcd (a
	  full-node), bitcoind, and neutrino (a new experimental light
	  client). The project's codebase uses the btcsuite set of
	  Bitcoin libraries, and also exports a large set of isolated
	  re-usable Lightning Network related libraries within it.
