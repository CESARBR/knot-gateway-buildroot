	  Neutrino is an experimental Bitcoin light client written in Go
	  and designed with mobile Lightning Network clients in mind. It
	  uses a new proposal for compact block filters to minimize
	  bandwidth and storage use on the client side, while attempting
	  to preserve privacy and minimize processor load on full nodes
	  serving light clients.
