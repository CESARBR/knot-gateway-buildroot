	  The PAN Network Manager is responsible for establishing a
	  Personal Area Network (PAN) with devices using this type of
	  protocol stack. In our reference implementation, the nRF24l01+
	  radio was used for the PAN network. The daemon nrfd has the
	  NRF24L01+drivers, PHY, Link, and network layers of this stack.
