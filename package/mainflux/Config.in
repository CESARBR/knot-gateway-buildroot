      Mainflux is modern, scalable, secure, open-source, and patent-free IoT cloud
      platform written in Go. It accepts user and thing connections over various
      network protocols (i.e. HTTP, MQTT, WebSocket, CoAP), thus making a seamless
      bridge between them. It is used as the IoT middleware for building complex IoT
      solutions.
